        <h1>BROWSER WARS</h1>
        <ul>
                <li>In 1993, Mark Anderson (Founder, MOSAIC) launched and tested MOSAIC with 12 people.</li>

                <li>     In February 1994, they took a plane to Illinois in order to form a team to expand their business and to have a free web browser for all.\</li>

                <li>    In the Summer of 1994, Jim Clarke and his team developed NetScape in a few months. It was better than MOSAIC and they knew they had to improve their browser to make it better and more compelling.
                </li>
                <li>    On 13th October 1994, ‘Navigator’ browser was launched by NetScape. It got millions of downloads. Microsoft realised that they were not the only giants in the IT industry anymore.
                    Bill Gates was shook by NetScape’s success and sent out a memo called ‘Internet Tidal Wave’ where he declared that the Web is the single most important component and that they had to match the level of NetScape or get better and beat NetScape.
